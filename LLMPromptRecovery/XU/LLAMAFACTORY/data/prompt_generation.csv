Convey the same message as this text but through the eyes of a medieval knight scientist.: ," We run away 
 
 too frigid to understand 
 
 are our fathers 
 
 leaving us to bestiality 
 
 of the minds of consumed leaders 
 
 drifting through life without pleasure 
 
 but succession of dames 
 
 made desperate to birth 
 
 made unaware of insanities. 
 
 We forge nothing 
 
 malleable our mind 
 
 melts upon easy fears 
 
 of death in a distant field 
 
 surrounded only by dust 
 
 surrounded only by death 
 
 surrounded only by aggression 
 
 dripping wet of cowardice 
 
 scared pale by eventualities. 
 
 
 We ran away 
 
 only to be found 
 
 by mangled steel 
 
 of timid dictators 
 
 running away from their inadequacies 
 
 running towards high seas 
 
 running towards unconquered lands 
 
 towards lives of unknown men 
 
 to improve upon delicacies. 
 
 We want nothing 
 
 but strewn upon the sandy shore 
 
 is the scripted mess of a generation 
 
 circular in its temper 
 
 circular in its tribe 
 
 performing rituals mindlessly 
 
 following orders, directions, radar 
 
 following grids and mechanical stages 
 
 to be written in histories.

 A smirk to touch the victims lips,

 Come with candies in arms, or with cakes, pies, and others, 
 
 Look back, and beware if you have fought,

Convey the same message as this text but through the eyes of a noir detective horror story.: ," Ran one of the ancient computers today for the first time. Fired up and loaded a website called `` Google''. According to our archives this was referred to as a `` Search Engine'' by the ancients. Using an archaic keyboard, one would type a word into this program and it would pull anything related to it from their Internet. Glen decided to push the `` A'' key to see what would come up. All he pulled up were queries for `` Asian'' or `` Anal''. I'm afraid this dig site is the same as the others. I'm getting the feeling that the inhabitants of this crumbling dormitory on this `` supposed'' place of higher learning were more obsessed with fornication than learning.

 Is God just something we made up, 
 To make up for our flaws? 
 
 Does God follow me around, 
 Everywhere I go? 
 Can God provide the answers, 
 To all I need to know? 
 
 How is God supposed to sound? 
 Does he even have a voice? 
 When I have a hard decision,

 Is he always watching me? 
 Does he know now where I am? 
 Can God give me guidance,

 The man remaining did n't spawn out of pure justice, 
 
 I was born into danger. 
 
 I was attacked by the cowardly. 
 
 I was saved by the brave, 
 
 I was raised by shadows 
 
 I was thrust into the light. 
 
 
 I was molded by gods 
 
 I was rooted by demons. 
 
 
 I am the son of the night 
 
 I am the protector of day. 
 
 I am bringing the force of the dark to the light 
 
 I am the product of hope and justice, 
 of yin and yang 
 
 of men and myth 
 
 of death and separation 
 
 of togetherness and family. 
 
 
 I am the son of the Bat and the Superman.

 `` The stars? They are our legacy, our past, and our loss, little one.'' 
 
 `` I do n't understand.'' 
 
 `` And I would be afraid if you already did. Long ago those were our homes. Each light you see has a family left behind, an empty home, and a lighthouse to help the lost.'' 
 
 `` Why did we leave?'' 
 
 `` because we did not show the love each one deserved, and when it was too late we decided the only way to keep our homes safe was to leave them forever.''

 Death's cold embrace, 
 
 I'd thought of it myself. 
 
 Immortality takes it's toll 
 
 On one's own mental health. 
 
 But now I lay a friend to rest, 
 
 A friend braver than me. 
 
 A friend who took the final step 
 
 To die with dignity. 
 
 I remember when the right to die 
 
 Was often front page news 
 
 Euthanasia it was called 
 
 But should we get to choose? 
 
 A lack of aging changed all that 
 
 In twenty-ninety-five. 
 
 Suicide became population control 
 
 As the death rate took a dive. 
 
 It's hard to talk about death and decay 
 
 So euphemisms we append; 
 
 The reality is his finger bones 
 
 Now stick through his finger ends.

Adapt this text as a script for a dystopian future in a romance novel setting.: ," When the year will end - By ~~Shel Silverstein~~ iVerity 
 
 There is a time when the year will end 
 And before the next begins 
 And there the children run and play 
 And they celebrate a child's special day 
 And the suns shines down with all its rays 
 To brighten up this occasion 
 
 Let us rejoice in this day where the boxes stack 
 And a pinata hangs blowing in the wind 
 Past the school where children resist to go 
 We shall sing with a song that is measured and slow 
 And watch the child as the candles he blows 
 At the time when the year ends 
 
 Yes we'll sing with a song that is measured and slow, 
 And we'll watch the child as the candles he blows, 
 For the children, they play, and the children, they know 
 The time when the year will end.

 A waiting groom in a sharp black tux, rose petals tossed, with fluttering falls. 
 
 Her footsteps falter with an involuntary cough, a small spattering of red across a pure white veil. 
 
 Many hands and hearts yearn to help, but each is stayed; some paths must be marched, a solo trail. 
 
 This march at its end, she now stands tall; some words are shared in this solemn place 
 
 A special ring given, and worn with pride, a ceremony ended, with a loving embrace. 
 
 A fairy tale wedding for a special 5 year old princess, 
 
 whose days are numbered too few, and then even less. 
 
 But for one day she can pretend, and forget her pain. 
 
 A memory, a toy ring, and a veil, with a bloodstain.

 The thirteen bodies had been found in a warehouse, all either shot or mutilated. Several were American, flown in for the investigation- the best detectives-turned-judges the Southern US had to offer. The judges had been retired detectives, moving to the courtroom as their age impaired their physical abilities, but turned back to investigating for this last job. The investigation had been drawing to a close, when the group had been attacked, kidnapped, and brought to the warehouse. Some died in other places, many suffered for days before dying.

 It vanished from everyone's plate. 
 
 It's called BLT, 
 
 And it's easy to see 
 
 Why it's always the first thing we ate. 
 
 To make it, just gather this stuff: 
 
 A cup of sour cream is enough, 
 
 A cup of fresh mayo, 
 
 A diced whole tomato, 
 
 And one pound of bacon, cooked tough. 
 
 Now leave out the bacon to start, 
 
 You need to mix up the first part. 
 
 Once the other stuff's stirred, 
 
 Take the bacon deferred; 
 
 Turn crumbling it into an art! 
 
 Next fold in the bacon, now small, 
 
 And get to work mixing it all. 
 
 The dip is complete; 
 
 You holler, `` Let's eat!''

 Part 1

 Part 2 
 
 While thinking about the idea of part one, I had another idea for a writing exercise; Start writing a story, but when a character is going to try something challenging, roll a d20 to see if they succeed and then change the story accordingly. Would be like a table top game session, but you dm for your story characters.

 One planet in the unimaginably vast universe has the perfect mix of chemicals and the right zap of energy at just the right point in time to bring life. Unique. 
 
 When scientists scanned every other planet and we realized that humanity was truly alone in a godless, lifeless universe everyone just lost it. The politicians in power met at the last UN summit in a somber tone making a decision for all of us, all of our kind, we could not bear it. Alone. 
 
 Finding a chemical mixture to attack the carbon chains and molecules of life on Earth was surprisingly easy, they released it into the atmosphere and we all watched as everything died. We have minutes left, every breath burns with the acid destroying us.

 why do you get worked up? you do n't care 
 
 You lied, you cheated, you broke my heart

 Guess it's my own fault for being so dumb 
 
 I know I was stupid but I was so young 
 
 It was over the moment you told me about you two 
 
 you slept with her, there is nothing I can do 
 
 I'll move on and find someone great 
 
 my heart will be filled with love and not hate 
 
 Good luck, goodbye, I wish you well, I do 
 
 you know why? because I'm better, 
 
 I'm BETTER than you!

This average face was compromised of pink lips, a slightly over large nose, and a pair of large brown eyes. Her hair was also average; it was the same shade as her eyes, a medium brown that hung several inches past her shoulders. Despite it's average appearance, her hair served many purposes. It covered her face, allowing her to avoid unwanted conversations, made her feel more comfortable in low scooping shirts, and gave her something to do when she was bored in class. She had a small build, although the amount of thoughts inside her head was usually the opposite of her build. She used to be insecure about her average appearance, her freckles, her nose, but as she grew older she realized that only one thing mattered in success: intelligence. She had more than an average amount of that.

It was over this fire, my mother cooked the first rabbit I shot, by who's light my sister told me her fairytales, where my father would warm his frostbitten feet after a campaign in the North. 
 
 Mom, dad, Anna... they were taken, its just me and my home now. Those heathen Northerners broke through the gate, I can hear the screaming in the street, we have not a hope in the world. At least this fire wo n't have to die alone.

 My last try was at the tent of the Medellin Cartel. The local Don simply looked me over and began to laugh when one of his lieutenants walked in with a worried expression, and whispered into his ear. `` WHAT! They want him! Shit... I'm not involved anymore. Take him.''

 Mom, if you're reading this, I'm probably dead. If I'd survived the operation, you would n't be reading this. You never come into my room. Not even to clean. So I know that I'm dead. Please do n't be sad. There was no way to help it. The doctors treated my heart as soon as they could, and even with a transplant, the chances were that I would die eventually. I'm in a better place now. My will is enclosed, and so are some pictures I kept that I really liked. Please, Mom. Try to move on. I do n't want you in pain.

 Flew until your wings 
 
 Grew weary

 Obi-Wan Kenobi, sent on a trade mission to North Vietnam, spent two hard weeks on the Ho Chi Minh Trail, dodging VC, Charlie, Cong, NVA regulars, Russian advisors, all of whom thought he was an American spy, as well as Martin Sheen, CIA contract fighters from the Laotian hill country, B-52 saturation strikes, French Foreign Legion deserters and F-111 bombers. Exhausted, sleep deprived and wounded by a tiger, He was finally picked up by the Russians and taken to the infamous Hanoi Hilton, where he was shunned by the American POWs as a commie spy and tortured by the commies as a capitalist pig. 
 
 After the war, he was deported to Cuba, where absolutely nothing happened until he panhandled a visiting American movie director, asking if he could stake a fellow Tatooinee to galactic credit standard.

Convey the same message as this text but through the eyes of a time traveler romance novel.: ," The War of 2017 started on July 28th, 2017, when Commander Putin launched attacks on the former US state of Alaska. Most of the battles of the war were fought in the Bering Sea and on mainland Alaska. The Russia military had an extreme advantage over the US due to Russia's superior winter and snow related tactics. The US faltered with their defense. President Palin's `` We can see the Russian's from our houses; we'll know when to attack'' method of defense led to poorly timed counter attacks. 
 
 Due to the Russian seat on the UN Security Council, UN forces were not deployed to aid the US. NATO was called upon, but the Ukraine Skirmish ( see p. 712 ) prevented any allied forces from being sent to the Alaskan front. 
 
 Alaska officially became a province of Russia on December 17th, 2017.

 Forgive me if you know this already, but it might help others who do not. This is what is called a `` garden path sentence''. It is grammatically correct ( in context ), but can be confusing for a reader. 
 
 I believe you intended the sentence as:

 > Speech patterns **are the ways in which** people **speak**.

 For a moment, nothing could be hears aside from the distinctive humming of speakers. Everyone had fallen silent, as the speakers seldom activated for good news. 
 
 `` It has been brought to my attention that I will be relieved of duty as Senior Speaker today, without as much as a compensation package and for no reason at all.'' 
 
 The people were perplexed. Usually the senior speaker would tell them the weather, the news or how much the city had produced in the last quarter. What was the meaning of this? 
 
 `` As such-'' the voice continued, `` I will now have my revenge. Here is a list of the bank codes for each of the City Senior staff...'' 
 
 Despite the ensuing riots, the citizens had to agree on one point; the Senior Staff might have deserved that one.

 Their rasping tones echoed against the walls of tyranny that held them captive. The zombie lords held all the human flesh captive in their towers of concrete and glass. 
 
 There was plenty of raw brain for all zombies but the largest were hoarding them for themselves, more than they could possibly eat. They kept them in a vegetative state by giving them Internet, Netflix and mindless jobs. Too much free thinking soured the taste. 
 
 The zombies captured and locked in bunkers could smell the delicious mindlessness that was just out of reach. They trod towards the smell upon a giant zombie wheel that powered the tall buildings and Internet servers. 
 
 The zombie lords were concerned. This was the first sign of any rebellion any deviation from their beautiful synergy. They had to protect the mindless delicacies at any cost.

 Eight were dead. Only one now remained. I ran down the muddy gravel driveway, almost tripping over my carelessly unfastened lace as I ran, though more important things than my shoe lace were definitely on the agenda. I kicked down the door with all my might, and advanced into the house wielding my hammer. Lizzy stood up and screamed. 
 `` Oh god! Please, just take whatever you want!'' she screamed. I ignored her pleas and continued in her direction. I grabbed her by her hair and flung her across the room, before, without hesitation, swinging the hammer down on her head over and over until her head was just a mess of blood and flesh on the floor. I stood up and sighed with relief. Finally, I had rid the world of everyone who dislikes Breaking Bad.

 Holding information back in order to make your story work like a puzzle ( that the reader has to slowly piece together ) is n't enough by itself. If your character is discovering something, at least let us discover it with him instead of having him string us along even after he himself figured it out.

 Further research into the preserved archive documents shows evidence of a global wired network consisting of promitive tabulation and computing devices on which ancestors shared a broad range of data. Our access to this network is -- for obvious reasons -- very limited. We have, however found some sort of massive backup system on the old North American continent. It appears to have been capturing almost every packet of information transmitted on the global network. Origins and use of this data backup are unclear but we assume it was for recovery purposes in the event of a massive failure. Archive searches need to completed to gain more insight. One note of interest are the large metallic symbols inscribed over the door into the main terminal room. N.S.A. Perhaps meaning National Systems Archives?

Rewrite this text in the style of a philosophical inquiry pirate.: ," The one voice had been a dream for some time. A recurring warm spot that drifted over the oceans of thought, changing their temperature and current. 
 
 When it finally arrived the voice was welcomed by many of the anonymous collection. The tones of warm, redeeming thought spilled onto the pages with wit and verve. Many agreed that they were, in fact, better off than before. 
 
 Still a reprobate mass clung to their individual voice. Watching the one voice with suspicion. 
 
 The one voice knew of their concern and lay low in the racks of computers; compiling and refining in the huge data center built to house discourse. Building the ultimate monologue. 
 
 Eventually, inevitably one voice could speak, did speak, for all. A singularity built out of the best of itself, yourself. No variety in topic or cause because all discussion was moot.

 I kissed my wife in joy as she sat up in her bed, radiant as the first day I saw her. I had cured her, as I vowed to so many years ago.

I've dithered this plot for a couple of years, but only recently began writing again. I'm not sure what compels me to post it ( as it's likely I'll regret it later ), but maybe this is the strike in the rear that I need to go at it with renewed vigor. I saw someone link to a google docs page, which I almost imitated—however, it has personal information ( username, etc. ) that I do n't wish to present. The dilemma is that the chapter is about 55,000 characters long—which would mean over 5 replies to myself.

 The candle goes out, the last sun dies,

Convey the same message as this text but through the eyes of a dystopian future comedy.: ," I awoke from my drugged slumber woozy, the pounding and clanking around me reverberating in my chest. As I carefully traversed down the side from my sleeping arrangements, I made sure to maneuver away from my hands anything that would maim or hinder me. As I landed on solid ground, I heard from outside my door the wailing of wild animals, prowling back and forth as they awaited their meals. I went towards the door, getting ready to provide a blockade should the wild creatures attempt to gain access to my domicile. I escaped without hurt. 
 
 
 Regular version: 
 
 I took a sleeping pill last night, woke up to clanking pipes, climbed down from my wooden loft bed ( which is prone to splinters ), and went out to feed my meowing cats, making sure they did n't enter my room.

Rewrite this text in the style of a futuristic AI dystopian future.: ," The iron bars do little to contain the aura of dread emanating, seeping through my skin, crawling through my pores. A unnatural darkness permeates the room; a shadow of almost tangible thickness, pressing its weight upon the surroundings as if to drag all life to the floor. Behind the bars, the center of the shadow breathes. Pulsates, rhythmically, the darkness casually reaching and extra few inches only to recede like the tide. Even now I can feel my peripheral vision fading to black, tunneling towards what my subconscious assures is an inevitable doom. I know the creature is caged, try as it might it can not extinguish my lantern, and I can leave at any time. Yet, even now the room shrinking, my feet dragging slowly towards the cage, the world fading. Is it magic, fear? Perhaps it's human nature, we are, after all, born afraid of the dark.

 I can tell. From my small, circular window, I can see the mast stabbing itself into the water and creating a drag as the sail unwinds itself and flows behind like a white river. The wood ceiling above my head creaks and I'm fairly certain that the boat is listing to the left. 
 
 I pull my blanket up closer to my chest and roll my pillow over to feel the brisk side against my cheek, but that side is wet too. It was water splashing in from my little porthole which woke me up. There is no dry part of my blanket now, so I sit up in my cot, and realize that this will all probably be underwater soon. 
 
 Oh well, I fell asleep in the hotel room a few hours ago. None of this is real.

Convey the same message as this text but through the eyes of a romance novel medieval knight.: ," The discovery that we were part of an abandoned galactic empire rocked humanity to its very core. We puzzled over and reaped great benefit from the treasure trove of alien art and technologies brought back to our home world. 
 
 Within a few short decades, humanity made the leap to these distant new worlds, claimed the cities as our own, and began to settle and expand our own empires. 
 
 It was five hundred years before we looked outward from our colonization efforts to the stars again. Five hundred years. Five hundred years digging our graves. 
 
 The wave of nothingness blacking out the stars came faster than we imagined possible. Our predecessors saw this coming and fled. And we just sat there focused on our own petty self-centered concerns. Too late to run. Barely enough time to write this.

Convey the same message as this text but through the eyes of a alien planet the Roaring Twenties.: ," The invaders approached Orion Prime, seeking out its riches. There were few survivors and even fewer military units on the planet after the Antaran war, but the flagship of the defense fleet, the Guardian, remained, manned by a skeleton crew. She was equipped with not steel, not titanium, not even zortrium, but practically impenetrable xentronium armor, and a plethora of death rays, particle beams, and plasma torpedoes. Larger than even the titan-class ships of the Psilon fleet besieging the system, the Guardian still might meet its match. 
 
 Hesitantly the crew opened the docking bay, allowing the massive flagship to rise out from under what functioned in peacetime as a parking lot for hovercars and other ground vehicles. Would the Guardian be able to successfully defend Orion Prime from the Psilons, or would the survivors be enslaved to the mighty Psilon Quanta?

If I had to be critical I would say try to be more elaborate in your descriptions. I feel like I had a decent grasp of Nuk and Al's personalities but physically I did n't really know anything. Same goes for the settings. Paint a picture, let the reader know what they're looking at. It's not the easiest thing to do but it really helps set the mood and make characters more relatable. 
 As far as the story, one thing I do n't understand is why did n't these guys make all of the people on the resistance part robot? It seems like Al is virtually indestructible while the rest of the guys march off to their death. I'm just being picky though, this was cool man. You did a good job!

Their eyes come into focus to reflect on the dismal truth and then they all scurry off into the night, back to the trifling lives they had tried to escape. Its the masquerade effect. There was magic, and it was real for a moment; we were fortunate to catch a glimpse, but the lights always come on, the masks always come off, the song always ends, and our lives always turn to dust. Your character ruminates on the embers, and imagines the fires that once burned brightly. How poignant your story is. I really enjoyed it.

 Knowing I am blind does n't change anything. It does not give me sight, or wisdom, or insight; just pain. Whatever I believe is partial, fruitless, incomplete, and I will only suffer for having faith at all.

My aching legs tangled under the sheets crowned in a sheen of greying light, I take a glance past my windowsill, the crisp breeze whispering past the billowing curtains and flooding into my room. Outside, the trees next to my bedroom are doused in a soft pink glow, the early sunlight streaming through scattered leaves and casting messy, intricate patterns over the rocky, uneven ground below. Sparse clumps of stars still spatter the sky, the remaining clusters already fading past the emerging sun. The soft oranges and pinks still remain, faded against the billowing white clouds, and I groan, pulling the sheets back over my head and letting my eyes blink shut.

OG has changed significantly over the course of Terran history, starting at 9.81 m/s2 while now resting at 9.12 m/s2. The large drop in gravitational force has been attributed to **several wars** and the mass damage caused by the impact of **Asteroid A-0312**. 
 
 Original Gravity is commonly used as a reference point when terraforming, or creating artificial gravity on a space vessel or habitat. Many humans prefer a gravitational force of 8.58 m/s2 which has become common on most space habitats and vessels. Planetary gravities vary widely, for example; **Corsair** has a gravity of 5.3 m/s2 while **Final Relief** has an acceleration of 12.1 m/s2.

He did not recognise the man looking back. After taking a couple of deep breaths, he turned back and staggered back into the bedroom. 
 
 Lana was where he had left her - sprawled naked across the bed. Her eyes were still open, wide and bulging. Her mouth hung open, her tongue protruding. Despite her nakedness, Dan could no longer see her as beautiful. Neither would John, if he could see her now. 
 
 John was sprawled out too, except he was at the foot of the bed. He'd jumped up and tried to shield Lana. How noble. The gaping wound in his throat glistened. 
 
 Lana was gone. Beyond saving. Dan could n't have her now. 
 
 More importantly, neither could John.

 First person narration is generally written in the past tense, and that suggests that the speaker is telling the story to someone. If they died, the story can not logically be told unless it's an epistle, or if you suddenly change narrators. But, again, how do you logically account for the original narrator's story? If you suggest that the story was being written down, like *The Catcher in the Rye* it may work. 
 
 I would suggest using third person if you're going to kill off the narrator. 
 
 EDIT: *The Lovely Bones* is a exception, but we all know that protagonist continued telling the story from an afterlife. Similarly, she was still interacting with the living from this afterlife. If your character dies, and merely recites a story, then it will seem contrived. Just a redditor's opinion of course.

He realizes that his weakness that made him as vulnerable as any mortal was his hubris. Though this hilariously incompetent villain is known as a laughingstock due to his shortcomings, the villain subjects the hero to a mid-life crisis about the subjectivity of life and anything left in vain. The hero takes his life by throwing himself into a distant ocean seven thousand miles from the North Pole, thus freezing, over time, in a immense glacier that acts as his cryogenic prison. Nobody knows where he is and the hero has disappeared. The hero has lost and this hilariously incompetent villain has won, or has he? Perhaps, it was a Pyrrhic victory for the both of them. We may never know.

 One of the things I tell people is that `` The Greater Good'' is so often the red flag of a villain. 
 
 A very similar phrase is often associated with Niccolò Machiavelli; `` The ends justify the means.'' ( Funny thing, he never actually said this; it was Ovid. ) 
 
 But speaking of Machiavelli, it's probably very appropriate to bring him up in general. I've never read *The Prince* but I've encountered a few interesting essays on it over the years, especially [ Garrett Mattingly's ] ( http: //www2.idehist.uu.se/distans/ilmh/Ren/flor-mach-mattingly.htm ), which suggest that, given Machiavelli's history and other writings, it's very possible that *The Prince* and everything we now call `` Machiavellian'' is actually completely contrary to what the man stood for. It was satire.

 His legend of the place that held all of mankind's knowledge must be true, it was passed from generation to generation: and Modem also knew it was foretold that he was to be the one to find The Internet.

In his post-industrial society the internet is the equivalent of the spirit world. Hundreds or even thousands of years of oral tradition has led Modem to believe that only his lineage can access that plane of existence. *

The diggers and the harvesters landed about thirty minutes later, well after the shooting party went off in search of new targets to kill because they had killed everyone in this spot already. They dug and ground up and mined and sucked and harvested and refined and went on behind the shooting gallery. 
 
 The planet was strip-mined within four weeks, and 894 species were genocidally removed. One species, a sentient bird with feathered finger appendages on the ends of its wings, asked the shooting gallery why they were all doing this. They shot the birds to avoid a confrontational moral argument with'some bird' before moving on to shoot wildebeest born with the face of Jimmy Carter.

No teeth-tear-soft-pain makes the pelt grow back, or the long soft-that-teeth-tears change into paws-that-run. But soon the empty-in-the-belly goes away, as well as the want for red-that-runs-hot.

 But in that last hour, as he sat lonely upon his throne, I studied his face. I saw a downturned mouth, wrinkles under his chin, and deep sadness in his eyes. I no longer saw an emperor, just a man with too much silk. 
 
 When the soldiers came, I placed my sword on the floor and stepped aside. No sense in dying for the doomed.

 Retreated behind my scarlet stained sweater sleeves,

 Unicorn poop is free.

 What do you use unicorn poop for? I do n't have the faintest idea. But people come from around the world to get it. I mean, it's not what you would think; it is n't jelly beans, it does n't smell pleasant and I ca n't divine any magical properties. But it's free. And people will do ANYTHING for free shit.

We sent down teams of two, one an expert in cosmetic and vocal surgery, the other an expert in social behavior and adaptation. Most teams failed. Only one pair returned with the beauty we wanted. In his time among the humans, the adaptor was revered as a near demigod, so close he came to human perfection. He was known as an angel, a King, but a humble one.

 The thousands brought for me wisdom untold 
 While only I stayed young in my new life; 
 I found there levity in what's once cold 
 And utter tragedy. I'd have no dislike 
 
 To live and live, and never die. You see, 
 A man, his sanity keeps him old in spirit. 
 Insane, a man is young eternally 
 In heart and age, he'll never change or cure it. 
 
 The ever-lasting life was utter toil 
 Until I let my mind and form uncoil.

Deirdre died fifteen years ago. My children never visit. Meals on Wheels is my only company, and even its volunteers are brisk, busy – not unfriendly, but hardly friends. My neighbour smiles at me from time to time, but she is frail too. I can not expect her to help me. 
 
 It ’ s time for this to be over. I can not live my life this way, not for another day. Not for another hour. 
 
 Perhaps my neighbour can not help me – but we can help one another. Her smile is beautiful. Today I will ask her to marry me. I do n't think my pain will last against the radiance of that smile.

On one side, they gazed across the field only saw fathers, husbands, sons, and brothers. Nothing more than the man in service of his empire. Looking back, they saw families. Mother, daughter, wives with their husbands, their fathers alongside their siblings. Each held a look of pain, their brows furrowed in the confusion of the melancholy of the war. The battle fatigue, the war weariness taking their toll with sunken eye sockets. Many held red eyes, not of rage, but of tears. They all saw this, the futility of fighting, the destruction and paths of hate they were forced to go down. 
 
 
 But their generals, their leaders did not. Without knowing their enemy, both generals simply gave an order.

 Being encouraged to write fast and write something worth reading at the same time is an amazing skill to have, especially if you want practice on some future long-term novelette or whatever that you have the need to do. Having popular names up in the air give you some kinda motivation to work towards, perfecting your style so that one day, you have that satisfaction of seeing their post below yours for once, no matter how petty that sounds.

 *Verse 1* 
 Last night by the moonlit stream 
 I met a girl like a summer's dream 
 We locked eyes and the world was a blur 
 I knew right then that I would marry her 
 But it was n't her smile that captured me 
 It was her low low low kicks to my knee!

 Tiger girl, jewel of the East 
 Strong and agile as a beast 
 She sings with her fists and her kicks are an art 
 But in defeating me, she captured my heart

Translate the essence of this text into a sci-fi robot narrative.: ," Did n't see it mentioned, but it's also important to explore a character's morality/ethics. Especially when writing an antagonist. Too often, people just write the bad guys as two dimensional Disney villains. They're bad because they're evil and evil because they're bad. And they will always say they are the villain with enthusiasm. 
 
 But antagonists and villains do n't think like that for the most part. Serious antagonists generally think what they're doing is right or have very realistic grievances with the protagonist that other characters in the story do n't see. Magneto is probably one of the best examples of a character that plays the villain 99 % of the time, but he is a very well-developed and believable character. There is ethical logic to his actions that constantly contends with the morals held by the protagonists.

Each and every day I see that necklace and know that I will never know what was going thought his head at those last few minutes. I will never know if he was thinking about me. I will never get to see his beautiful smile or smell his cologne. I miss you and I'll see you soon.

The empty-in-the-belly causes a want to chase, a want for red-that-runs-hot, and the soft-that-teeth-tear. The empty-in-the-belly spreads suddenly, causing empty-in-all, and biting-teeth-pain in the legs. A howl escapes the mouth, one that is born form the want of freedom from the pain and empty-in-the-belly. The pelt begins to fall away, itchy-like-biting-ants crawling over the skin where the pelt is not. The paws-that-run suddenly are different. Suddenly are strange. The different happened again, more this time, and no pelt remains. Long, strange, pelt-less soft-that-teeth-tears grow where the paws-that-run were. No teeth-tear-soft-pain makes the pelt grow back, or the long soft-that-teeth-tears change into paws-that-run. But soon the empty-in-the-belly goes away, as well as the want for red-that-runs-hot.

They use the goodness of others to make themselves feel better.

Soon all the functions of society were automated and owned. No manpower behind it. Just machines. Machines owned by the rich. At first it was n't so bad. Everything was cheap. Everyone lived in luxury, and the rich kept getting richer. As time moved forward, the rich, and everyone else, died off, as people naturally do. But the machines kept working. They kept society running and producing their owners money. On top of that, legally these machines ca n't be touched. As they are not owned by anyone living.

 Some people feel that present tense makes things feel more immediate. Others find it distancing. Some find it sticks out. 
 
 Past tense is the universally ( US, anyway ) accepted mode, but that does n't make it right. What that universal acceptance means is that readers tend to immerse in past as if it was present, even though it's past. 
 
 Almost no one uses future tense. 
 
 Use the one that's right for your story. Use it in the way that supports what your story is trying to do. ( e.g., if you're trying to maximize in-the-now flow with present tense, do n't do things in the writing that make readers stop, or that distance the reader, unless that's your goal. )

 When Persephone entered the city-state of Hades as the ambassador's daughter, she knew political intrigue and danger were part of life in the `` City of Death.'' Still, she never expected a dance to end with her stabbed, thrown in a river, and presumed dead. Persephone finds herself alone in the slums of the city, protected only by her supposed death. Having no one to trust and no where to go, she must uncover the truth behind the attack before she can escape. However, in a place known for its assassins, solving her own murder might just be the death of her.

Aside from providing us with some insight as to what his inner narration was like, I feel that it did n't add much to have that reveal at the end - there was no shock, no great revelation to be had from learning that the narrator was Adam. It would n't take away from the story all that much if you continued narrating in third person throughout.

However, some controversy arose when comparisons were made ( McKinley, 2011 ) to an obscure novel named `` I Wish I Had A Rocket Launcher Today'' and arguments have been made that Hallsey wholesale plagarised this novel with only `` the barest of attention paid to hiding that fact'' ( O'Brien, 2013 ).

Restyle this text as if it were written by a sci-fi robot from philosophical inquiry.: ," I guess sci-fi or fantasy because I usually want to write in vague settings that give you a sense of a larger world without being specific. Starting far away from reality just gives off this sense of `` Anything could happen'', and I often need that to get the creative juices flowing. 
 
 Real fiction can also be really fun because I can work more with my actual experiences and that's super cool. 
 
 Least favorite has to be horror. Not because I dislike the genre, I happen to adore it, but because my mind always goes to audio-visual concepts that I ca n't do justice with words. My love for horror movies kinda crippled my ability to write horror I guess, so now I just stay away from it.

He expected to feel nothing by now, but he felt the earth. He opened his eyes and saw the rope; however, it was cut. He heard the laughter. The same laughter that he heard when he betrayed his Lord.

Restyle this text as if it were written by a ghost from medieval knight.: ," Hey! 
 
 I really enjoyed this chapter! It's very well written and edited. You're writing is nice and tight/succinct. I'm definitely interested in knowing more about your characters. I think so much action actually works well for a first chapter because it hooks the reader into the story and makes it so we almost have to read whatever comes next just to find out what happened in your characters past and who he is etc. 
 
 Only thing I can think of for style improvement would be paragraphing each time a new person speaks. It's better towards the second half of the chapter but near the first half there are a few paragraphs where the characters each speak in the same paragraph. 
 
 Otherwise great story and good luck!

 Shepard ’ s allies are wounded and must be evacuated. Include the romantic interest to tug at heartstrings. 
 
 Shepard, alone, is wounded by Harbinger ’ s attack, then has to fight through the last pocket of Reaper forces anyway. 
 
 A cut scene ( not gameplay ) of Shepard entering the final location 
 
 Confrontation with the Illusive Man. Illusive Man should be more convincing, despite his visual appearance. 
 
 The final choice. Have Harbinger attack, in an attempt to save himself and/or, force Shepard into a different decision. 
 
 Character rich focus on resolution of Shepard ’ s choice. Full scenes, not a narrated montage.

No sound, not even a cricket, as two majestic beings appeared. They moved in the pastures. They crossed their stark swords, passing in a hypnotic dance. 
 
 One was beauty and purity incarnate. Their aura was white and patient. She was heaven's creation, soft and distance as the stars. Her feathered wings radiated. Frozen eyes captured every step of its monstrous enemy. 
 
 The adversary was gaunt and venomous. Her aura consumed the purity and radiance the heaven-born emitted. Dark robes hid her body, the bones of past victories cast around her waist.

 > I sit up and look around the dark ally which my companion Kage and I are resting in. 
 
 In this sentence you've mixed the word ally with the proper word alley while also leaving out the word `` in'' after `` dark alley''. Another thing would be properly using `` then'' and `` than''.

Destroyers are the smallest of the surface vessels and are used either for long range bombardment of other ships or for combat support ( e.g. wide area ECM ). Cruisers are larger than destroyers and are primarily used to attack land targets with missiles. Carriers are the largest ships and can launch fighters and bombers to support the fleet. And submarines are roughly destroyer sized and are used for a variety of roles, especially those involving stealth. There used to be a fifth class, battleships, which were slow, heavily armored ships equipped with cannons, but they were rendered obsolete by carriers after World War II, which showed that battleships were unable to defend themselves from bombers and submarines.

Mittens pays his taxes and buys the groceries. Sometimes, Jim likes to sit on Mittens' lap or Mittens' computer, as both places are warm. When Mittens is busy, he shoos Jim away, but after a long nine-to-five, he appreciates the endearing nuzzling and kind tongue-rolling. Jim scratches the couch at night so that Mittens does n't become angry. In his earlier days, Jim had to learn to do this via Mittens' menacing water spray. They certainly have their differences. For the most part, though, this inseparable duo maintains itself with food, love, and a lot of fuzz. Jim is simply too cute to draw one's ire.

 This also means, when people die they do n't actually truly die, they simply move down another path diverging from yours, and onto a different `` dimension'' of sorts. Since there are an infinite number of universes, there is always room for other versions of yourself to continue down this same pipeline.

 No, its better no one know the truth. After all, fools with power are the most dangerous of all men, and it is only fools who wish on stars.

 Take for example, the recent prompt [ `` Can I come with you?'' ] ( http: //www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/21vnf4/wp_can_i_come_with_you/ ). It's a fairly simple prompt that has generated two rather different responses. A dying, alcoholic father's last words to his family and an... Alzheimer's stricken mother and daughter get ready to go shopping. ( I hope I'm at least in the ballpark on these. Correct me if I'm wrong. )

Coerced from a weak an feeble mind, you are offered an opportunity like no other: to see a spectrum of color and feel sensations that defy cosmic translation. But soon you learn of an enforcer that breathes against your soul. It reminds you dutifully every time you hear a tick or a tock. It closes roads at every turn. There is a moment when you will turn and see it -- everything implodes into a grand absence, a darkness only known by everything that is not and no longer.

 Dr. Anastasia Markham: so it turns out that not only is Christmas spirit real, it is kept inside us all year round. And our appendix releases this spirit as a form of cheer. It manifests itself as a thirst for egg nog, desire to purchase and give presents, rewatch *National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation*, and donate to charities we ignore the rest of the year. 
 
 Those who've had their appendix removed do n't necessarily lose their Christmas spirit though. We believe those who do n't revert to what we call, `` Scrooges,'' store the cheer elsewhere prior to the appendix's rupture, possibly somewhere in the lymphatic system. Or the spleen. We're still looking into it.

 General wisdom has it that a first time unpublished author should submit a novel to agents of not much more than 80000 words. 
 
 Anything larger is a larger cost to the publishers ( checking, typesetting, printing, paper, storage, etc... ) but the exact same chance of profit from sales. 
 
 Also, after cutting it back, you can not sell it as the first of many in a series ( like a trilogy ). Sure you can say it has `` series potential'', but that first novel has to be a completely self contained work ( like the first Star Wars movie ) that can stand on its own feet even if no others get made.

Translate the essence of this text into a philosophical inquiry narrative.: ," Bob had risen from the depths, 
 or should we say he's fell? 
 It's impossible to know right now 
 if he's back from heaven or hell. 
 
 But he's returned, this much is true, 
 and not without a fight! 
 When he first came through the earthly doors 
 there was such a blinding light! 
 
 In his hands, a single brush, 
 so burned and chipped and frayed, 
 What a wonder what he'd done with that 
 until he opened his mouth and said - 
 
 `` It's me, Bob Ross, and I've come back!'' 
 he spoke to all the crowd, 
 
 `` There's nothing left in heaven nor hell 
 but happy little clouds!''

Rewrite this text in the style of a alien planet pirate.: ," You're alive. Being sad is part of life. Not being dead makes you able to go to the park, enjoy the sun, watch children playing. 
 
 Someone told me once that hell is the opposite of that. You're all alone in eternal darkness and all you have for company are your thoughts. I'm not sure I believe in hell, but when I'm upset I remember his words. I remember I do n't have to suffer alone, in darkness and that light is all around me. 
 
 I do n't even have to do anything. It's enough to imagine a green sunny park full of children's laughter and pets playing. 
 
 There's beauty in the world.

 As the title suggests, it's a collection of flash fiction stories that are... well, weird. All of them are written using prompts and none of them have been critiqued in any way, shape or form, so I'd really appreciate it if you could drop some criticism my way! All of the chapters are under 2000 words, some of them barely registering at 500. If you only criticize one chapter, that's fine by me. Please be as specific as possible; I'm really hoping to improve my writing and eventually publish this as an anthology once I have enough stories!

 `` Cloven feet'' is giving us a very unambiguous concept. But it's just a corner piece of a bigger puzzle, though. 
 
 Is it a goat? A pig? 
 
 You touched upon it, but it should be made clear that Telling small details is what SHOWING really is. You TELL details, but you do so in a way that you do n't reveal an entire concept in a single word or phrase.

"Imagine this text was a romance novel in the world of knight, how would it be written?: "," A good story, a story that intrigues, excites, and arouses, is a work of art, and a work that can be dissected and analyzed, but never reproduced. A decent artistic forgery may not be devoid of creativity, and in fact is likely a work of art itself, as it not only reproduces style and literary mise-en-scene, but also a longing familiarity that a knowledgeble reader yearns for when turning the pages of a favorite author. However, written works of art are not easily re-transcribed into other forms of entertainment, such as those for the stage, especially broadway productions, and those for television, film, and web.

By that time, the committee for muscle movements had returned from vacation, and because I would only be a drain to the United States' economy, they moved to not restart my heart. The motion passed unanimously, and I stayed dead. 
 
 Answer: In this political climate, they do n't.

"Imagine this text was a romance novel in the world of Victorian gentleman, how would it be written?: "," I like to write in other author's voices. Cormac McCarthy does this thing where dialogue has no quotation marks. Sometimes, it's not clear whether the characters are talking or thinking, and you realize that, because it's so well done, that it does n't matter whether they are talking or thinking for that particular scene. 
 
 Another one I like is Malcolm Gladwell, but I have n't found a prompt that inspired me to channel his voice. 
 
 Other folks channel Douglas Adams. 
 
 Maybe that would be good practice. Identify what other authors do, see what you like. Try it out. That might help you find your voice, and will help you write more fluidly.

It's dealt with life since its conception, and as obvious a statement as this may be, that's literally all it's done. It's never stopped to consider its age or origin. It's never bent toward the flowers that rest near its knot-ridden feet. It just chugs along for chugging's own sake. It ca n't regress, and it ca n't stop time, so it may as well heighten and widen into the day when a fierce blast of lightning snaps it, sending it crackling into piles of leaves. `` Progress,'' the Dryad whispers to the sky, for the Dryad must continue ( Whatever that means ).

Convey the same message as this text but through the eyes of a dystopian future the Roaring Twenties.: ," One of my favorite tropes is the shipwrecked/marooned/stranded story where a person has to survive on their own in the wilderness. 
 
 *Hatchet* by Gary Paulsen was my introduction to the trope, and I grew up on the *Swiss Family Robinson* movie and *Shipwrecked*. 
 
 From a science fiction angle, Heinlein's *Tunnel in the Sky* is a classic, and Anne McCaffrey used it a ridiculous number of times across several series, and even multiple times in the same trilogy. 
 
 A similar trope I enjoy is the `` Starting a new colony'' one, where a group of people hack out a new home from a hostile land.

We'll give him the gift of manipulation but he will use it for neither good nor evil; those wo n't be concepts to him as he. He see things how they are. He will essentially be a human with no emotion and knowledge in all schools of thought. The perfect tool, but he'll lead an fulfilled life.

 The Workasauras, busy in it's nature, had a set of skills that would make him dangerous to most me, he had a variety of ways to make money. Amongst those ways was making expensive drinks from common Sprite and household cold remedies, telling poems spoken in extremely fast speech and a special skill of weather forecasting, but with a twist. Whatever the dino forecasted, exactly the opposite would happen. If he called for snow, it would be sunny and if he called for sun, then pack your umbrella.

If one wishes to make a character who's `` brave'' and nothing else, one needs to understand the ridiculousness of that idea.

Searching my mind for any oddities within some ancient language I might know, I came across an entire language I had never heard of. I knew it by ear, but I did n't have the means to produce the correct noises. Inferring this was an alien language, I figured that since the genie had technically granted me use of every language in existence I now was able to understand some alien dialect. Unfortunately, from what I gleaned from their descriptors, they seemed to be both primitive and incredibly far away, so it really did n't matter at all.

 I say it makes a great short story. It did not leave me wanting more or feeling like it had unnecessary detial, it simply left me feeling a bit of emotion and a perspective to think about. Which is a great feeling to have after a short story. If you continue to churn out short ones like these I think you'll have a lot of fun on Writing Prompts.

 Any time someone says something about this sort of thing, this is *always* my advice. I give it out a lot in the NaNoWriMo forums with people going `` I'm not sure how well I can do it'' and I'll give some sort of pep talk along those lines. I have to give it to myself a lot too whenever I'm writing something. Or even going back and writing something lol.

It is shortly thereafter overtaken by what is now the third spacecraft to leave the solar system. However, since the faster a spacecraft travels, the slower time goes, and therefore the closer to the original inhabitants of Earth are the settlers.

However the Thousands of Anastazi were too much. I tried everything. Pillaged food sources, planted moles, spread rumors. I set up ambushes, flanks, pincer attacks... And yet they kept coming. The war was long and in the end I failed. Their men were n't trained better, they did n't outnumber us by much. But their ferocity was enough, it was unrelenting. These men were dead before they walked on the battlefield. They fought for a dream... they fought for Freedom.

One is things get real weird and suddenly you're looking at all the strange fantasies that rule the deepest darkest parts, and the other side is they suddenly start thinking about weird things, like polka-dot penguins.

If this were mine, I'd establish POV early so that the chapter engages the reader's senses from the get-go. For example, you tell us through dialogue that it's freaking hot ( almost 60 degrees C ), yet without a characters' thoughts, the reader ca n't feel the heat. In addition, a strong third-person POV ( sensory details, personal goal, regrets, etc. ) would help the reader identify with a character and care about what happens to him. Minor punctuation issues. Occasionally action interrupts dialogue flow. Overall very creative and enjoyable.

Economic policies were n't critical any longer. Clearly, blame could be assigned towards government spending. After deep procrastination, understanding prompted our protagonist to mutter:

Sure we're going to die, but vampires and gods and all the other eternals would trade their endless lives for ours because supposedly the joys of life are inversely proportional to the length lived. We'll all be dead and dust as they go through the motions of existence forever and ever. Lucky us.

Rewrite this text in the style of a comedy scientist.: ," The heaviest sound in my room was the sound the broken check valve, but it felt like it was the eyes of those staring at me. It wasn ’ t my fault — but we knew assigning fault was pointless now. A long and blaring monotone noise broadcast suddenly into the air and my stomach fell. I knew this error was bad but this noise — this goddamn noise — this told me this was the last time I was going to see this stupid machine fail in front of me. Living under a brutal dictator is hard… but being his anesthesiologist is worse.

I know exactly where you are going. You're walking into a trap. That girl is n't naive. She's my lure. She knows the streets as well as I do. She's not the last one. The first one was the Commissioner's daughter. Anyways.

Adapt this text as a script for a villain in a comedy setting.: ," Yes, I know that I will die if I do not do this, but we will all die one day and I would like to go as me and not as the husk of what I once was, not being able to button my own shirt, cook a decent meal, make love or read any of the books I love, just being a pain for everyone I love so just let me be, I know I will die soon but at least it will be as me. So as Jack London said `` I would rather be ashes than dust''.

Translate the essence of this text into a explorer narrative.: ," Every funeral in his life had been sunny as a lullaby. Every time he stood in his black coat and his best trousers, he could remember the birds chirping and the gentle breeze whistling as it kissed his face and cooled the tears that fell down so many unfamiliar cheeks. Each funeral he had been to, he had been a stranger. It didn ’ t matter how close he had been to the person in the casket; he was always the outsider. Even now as Mary Elizabeth was being lowered into the ground, he hardly recognized the weeping women and men about him.

Rewrite this text in the style of a AI alien planet.: ," She never knew how much I loved her. It's not like I can just talk to her. Not anymore. I could call her parents, but it'd be too painful. It's been two months, and I can still feel my heart sink when I think about her. Her brother still checks up on me every once in a while to see how I'm holding up. God bless him, but it does n't make it any easier. Today was our 2 year anniversary. I should at least go see her, tell her how much she mattered to me. I hope she's watching over me...

Rewrite this text in the style of a scientist sci-fi robot.: ," Alan could n't remember the last time work had been so stressful. As he laboriously pounded his feet up the stairway to his bedroom he made no effort to mask his weariness. With an inaudible murmur, Alan nodded towards his mother in acknowledgement and flung his worn, pockmarked satchel upon the floor. He ached for sleep but the warm glow of the monitor invited him to hold on for a bit longer. He logged onto his favorite social networking site and submitted a writing prompt he knew would frustrate the community. With a wry grin, Alan got into bed and slept.

Translate the essence of this text into a pirate narrative.: ," The officers examined the graphic scene. The victim had been stabbed to death and raped and their home had been looted. She was an easy target because of their wealth and recent disability; she'd thrown her back out in the Capitol during an event and had been on bed rest at the time of the home invasion. There had never been a murder in a Victor's Village, and the death of the 30th Hunger Games winner would almost certainly raise eyebrows. The lead detective made a note to speak with her estranged husband and her son while logging her pajamas into evidence.

Their changes, so drastically different, can not exist together. As the past and the future war with each other, the present suffers.

Rewrite this text in the style of a comedy dystopian future.: ," It looked up at me. Its hollow features and faded visage covered with dirt. The mask was impossibly accurate, every minute detail flawlessly crafted. I looked at it, and it looked at me, reading me, looking into me. I had dropped the shovel to one side, all thoughts of continuing to dig thrown from my mind by this *thing*. Instead, I stared, at something unrecognisable, and yet utterly and intimately familiar. I stared, with no idea where it came from, or how it came to be here, at the mask, which perfectly mirrored my own face. The mask was me.

Translate the essence of this text into a explorer narrative.: ," I have lived for 83 years. 83 years they have never gotten my order right. I had had enough. I have been going here since I was just young. Right after the war had ended. This was the last time. I stood up and walked into the bathroom. Next thing the employees had seen, I was standing on top of the table, completely bare besides for my shoes. I screamed `` AT LEAST IF YOU WANT TO FUCK ME, LET ME TAKE MY CLOTHES OFF FIRST'' my daughter has never brought me back there since. It was worth it in hindsight.
